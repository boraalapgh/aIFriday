# Session Manager Context - Week 1

## Primary Decisions Made

### Session Structure Analysis
**Challenge**: Inaugural session needs to establish format while delivering immediate value
**Decision**: Standard 60-minute AI Friday format with first-session adaptations
**Rationale**:
- Proven format reduces execution risk
- Adaptations address community building needs
- Time allocation balances education and interaction

### Theme Implementation Strategy
**Selected Theme**: "Prompt Engineering Basics"
**Content Foundation**: Session C baseline topic (Prompt Engineering Playbook for ICs)
**Adaptation Level**: Medium - simplified for broader audience, added interactive elements

**Framework Selection**:
1. **CLEAR Framework** - Most beginner-friendly, practical structure
2. **Chain of Thought** - Universal applicability
3. **Few-Shot Learning** - Concrete examples approach
4. **Role + Constraints** - Professional context focus
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Growth mindset approach

### Host Configuration
**Co-Hosting Approach Selected**:
- **Primary Host (Bora Alap)**: Main facilitator, demo presenter
- **Co-Host (Remy Reurling)**: Technical support, clinic moderator, audience engagement

**Benefits**:
- Reduces single-host pressure for inaugural session
- Allows specialization (content vs. logistics)
- Provides backup if technical issues arise
- Models collaborative learning approach

### Timing and Pacing Strategy
**Modified Standard Format**:
```
0:00-0:05  Welcome & AI Friday Introduction (extended from 2 min)
0:05-0:13  Lightning Talk: 5 Frameworks (8 min vs. standard 7 min)
0:13-0:33  Live Demo: Ticket → PRD (20 min standard)
0:33-0:45  Hands-on Practice (12 min - added for first session)
0:45-1:00  Open Clinic: Q&A (15 min standard)
```

**Rationale for Changes**:
- Extended welcome establishes AI Friday purpose and expectations
- Hands-on practice increases engagement and immediate value
- Maintains proven demo timing for content delivery

## Resource Allocation Decisions

### Content Preparation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Demo materials and live examples
2. **Medium Priority**: Lightning talk slides (baseline content available)
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced clinic topics (can be improvised)

### Backup Content Strategy
**Prepared Backups**:
- Session C baseline topic available in full
- Additional prompt examples from community topic ideas
- Interactive exercises from prompt engineering playbook
- Technical troubleshooting scenarios

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Low Attendance**: Inaugural session interest unknown
2. **Technical Issues**: Co-hosts both new to format
3. **Content Pacing**: Interactive elements may extend timing
4. **Audience Engagement**: Mixed experience levels

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Attendance**: Comprehensive communication plan, multiple channels
2. **Technical**: Co-host backup system, pre-session tech check
3. **Pacing**: Flexible timing with priority content identified
4. **Engagement**: Multiple interaction opportunities, varied content formats

## Handoff to Content Curator

### Materials to Generate
- **Co-host coordination guide**: Role clarification and transitions
- **Demo preparation package**: Examples, prompts, expected outputs
- **Interactive exercise prompts**: Audience participation materials
- **Resource compilation**: Links, templates, and takeaways

### Context Provided
- Session structure finalized with timing
- Co-hosting roles and responsibilities defined
- Content framework selected and prioritized
- Risk mitigation strategies established

### Success Metrics
- Session execution matches planned structure
- Co-hosts coordinate smoothly
- Interactive elements engage audience
- Community interest generated for future sessions

## Cross-Week Learning Setup

### Data Collection Points
- Attendance tracking and engagement patterns
- Content section effectiveness (feedback)
- Co-hosting model success evaluation
- Community interest and topic requests

### Optimization Areas for Week 3+
- Timing adjustments based on actual pacing
- Host role refinement based on strengths
- Content complexity scaling based on audience
- Interaction format improvements
