# Content Curator Context - Week 1

## Content Strategy Execution

### Baseline Topic Adaptation
**Selected Foundation**: Session C (Prompt Engineering Playbook for ICs)
**Adaptation Level**: Moderate - maintained core frameworks, added inaugural session elements
**Target Audience**: All ICs with mixed AI experience levels

**Key Adaptations Made**:
- Simplified framework explanations for broader audience
- Added extended AI Friday introduction (inaugural session requirement)
- Enhanced hands-on practice component for engagement
- Structured co-hosting approach for content delivery

### Framework Selection Rationale
**Chosen 5 Frameworks**:
1. **CLEAR (Context-Length-Examples-Action-Role)** - Most structured, beginner-friendly
2. **Chain of Thought** - Universal applicability, works across roles
3. **Few-Shot Learning** - Concrete, example-driven approach
4. **Role + Constraints** - Professional context, boundary-setting
5. **Iterative Refinement** - Growth mindset, continuous improvement

**Frameworks Excluded**:
- Advanced chaining techniques (too complex for first session)
- Tool-specific patterns (maintaining universality)
- Meta-prompting approaches (requires more experience)

### Demo Content Development
**Selected Example**: Messy Jira ticket transformation
**Rationale**:
- Universal work experience across roles
- Clear before/after demonstration opportunity
- Multiple framework applications possible
- Immediate practical relevance

**Demo Structure**:
1. **Information Extraction** using Role + Constraints (6 min)
2. **PRD Generation** using CLEAR Framework (8 min)
3. **Test Plan Creation** using Role + Constraints (4 min)
4. **Live Commentary** throughout for educational value

## Speaker Coordination Strategy

### Co-Host Content Division
**Bora Alap (Primary Host)**:
- AI Friday introduction and community building
- Complete lightning talk delivery (5 frameworks)
- Primary demo presenter with live AI interaction
- Content expertise provider during Q&A

**Remy Reurling (Co-Host)**:
- Technical support and backup systems
- Hands-on practice session leadership
- Chat monitoring and audience engagement
- Clinic moderation and community facilitation

### Content Preparation Materials Created
1. **Co-Host Coordination Guide**: Detailed role definitions, transition management, emergency procedures
2. **Demo Preparation Package**: Specific prompts tested, expected outputs, backup examples
3. **Interactive Exercise Framework**: Hands-on practice structure, audience participation methods
4. **Resource Compilation**: Templates, links, takeaway materials organized

## Community Engagement Elements

### Inaugural Session Adaptations
**Extended Welcome (5 min vs. 2 min standard)**:
- AI Friday concept introduction
- Community purpose and format explanation
- Expectation setting for biweekly cadence
- Collaborative learning tone establishment

**Hands-On Practice Addition (12 min)**:
- Interactive audience participation with personal work examples
- CLEAR framework group exercise
- Chain of Thought application practice
- Immediate framework application opportunity

### Follow-Up Content Strategy
**Immediate Value Delivery**:
- Complete prompt template library
- Downloadable framework reference cards
- Recorded demo with timestamps
- Resource links for continued learning

**Community Building Setup**:
- Topic suggestion collection system
- Future speaker identification process
