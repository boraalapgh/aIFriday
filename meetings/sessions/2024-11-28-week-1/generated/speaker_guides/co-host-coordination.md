Remy: "Thanks Bora! I'm excited to see these frameworks in action with your real work. Let's start by thinking of something messy from your own projects..."
```

**To Clinic (0:45)**:
```
Bora: "Great practice session! Now let's open it up for questions, troubleshooting, and deeper discussion. Remy, let's hear what's on everyone's mind."

Remy: "Perfect! This is where we dig into your specific challenges. What questions do you have about prompt engineering? What would you like help troubleshooting?"
```

#### Remy → Bora Transitions:
**During Demo Support**:
```
Remy: "I see a question in chat about Chain of Thought - Bora, can you elaborate on when that works best?"

Bora: "Absolutely! Chain of Thought is especially powerful when..."
```

### Timing Coordination
#### Time Check Signals:
