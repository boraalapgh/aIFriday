## One-Week Follow-Up Message

### Subject: How are those prompt frameworks working for you?

Hi AI Friday community!

It's been a week since our inaugural session on prompt engineering. We're curious - how are those 5 frameworks working out in your daily AI interactions?

### 🔍 We'd Love to Hear:
- **Which framework** has been most useful for you?
- **Any specific wins** with improved prompts?
- **Challenges** you're still facing?
- **Unexpected applications** you've discovered?

### 📊 Quick Wins We've Heard So Far:
- Sarah used CLEAR framework to get better design feedback from AI
- Mike applied Chain of Thought to break down complex coding problems
- Lisa used Role + Constraints for more professional content generation

**Share your story** - reply to this email or post in [TEAM_CHANNEL]!

### 🗓 Upcoming: AI Friday Week 3 - December 12th

Based on your feedback, we're planning a session on **"AI Tools for Design Workflows"** - practical tools and techniques for designers (and anyone working with visual content).

**Mark your calendars** and let us know if you have specific design + AI topics you'd like us to cover!

### 💡 Mid-Session Tip:
If you're finding AI responses too generic, try combining frameworks:
1. Start with **Role + Constraints** to set context
2. Add **Few-Shot Learning** with examples
3. Use **Iterative Refinement** to improve the output

Keep experimenting and sharing your discoveries!

### Weekly Check-In Template

### 🧠 AI Friday Weekly Check-In

Hey AI Friday community!

**This week's prompt challenge**: Take something you normally ask AI to do and apply the **Iterative Refinement** approach:

1. **First try**: Use your normal prompt
2. **Critique**: What's missing or unclear in the response?
3. **Refine**: Rewrite the prompt addressing those issues
4. **Compare**: How much better is the second result?

**Share your before/after** if you try this! Learning from each other's experiments is what makes this community valuable.
