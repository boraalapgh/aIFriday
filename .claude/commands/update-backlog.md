Manage the AI Friday idea backlog, submissions, and topic queue.

You are managing the AI Friday content pipeline. Follow this workflow:

1. **Review current state:**
   - Check the submissions queue for new topics
   - Review the idea backlog for ready-to-promote items
   - Assess upcoming sessions that need speakers

2. **Process new submissions:**
   - Parse submission details (topic, speaker, format, timing)
   - Categorize by type (lightning talk, demo, clinic topic)
   - Assign to appropriate upcoming sessions
   - Flag any that need follow-up or clarification

3. **Manage the queue:**
   - **Priority queue**: Urgent/timely topics for next 2-3 sessions
   - **Medium queue**: Good topics for 4-8 weeks out
   - **Baseline topics**: Keep Sessions A-F ready as backups
   - **Parking lot**: Ideas that need more development

4. **Generate speaker outreach:**
   - Create personalized ask templates for specific topics
   - Identify internal experts who could present
   - Generate "call for submissions" messages for channels

5. **Balance sessions:**
   - Ensure good mix of lightning talks and demos
   - Avoid topic clustering (too many similar topics in one session)
   - Keep beginner-friendly content in the mix

6. **Update tracking:**
   - Maintain the master topic database
   - Update session assignments
   - Track speaker commitments and confirmations

7. **Generate recommendations:**
   - Suggest optimal session combinations
   - Identify gaps in coverage
   - Recommend baseline topics when needed

Keep the AI Friday pipeline full and engaging!
